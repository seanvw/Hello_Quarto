This is now my favored method for setting up a Quarto website template. Reason: simplicity and one can see what is going on.

1.  Create github repo on web. Clone it locally.

2.  Create a New Project \> Quarto Website within the clone as sub-folder but without the git option

3.  With terminal, inspect Quarto files, then move them up from sub-folder. Delete sub-folder.

4.  Edit .gitignore adding site/ and .DS_Store/

5.  Edit \_quarto.yml, add some Example #n files, edit index.qmd, about.qmd

6.  Choose a standard HTML theme from list [html-themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html "html-themes")

7.  Check-in files to github

8.  quarto publish gh-pages
