This is now my favored method for setting up a Quarto website template.

Reasons: relatively simple and one can easily see what is going on.

Noted here as recipe

1.  Create github repo on GitHub web. Clone it locally.

2.  Within Rstudio \> Create a New Project \> Quarto Website within the clone as sub-folder but *without the git option*

3.  Within Rstudio Terminal, inspect Quarto files, then move them up from sub-folder. Delete the sub-folder.

4.  Within Rstudio \> Edit .gitignore adding \_site/ and .DS_Store/

5.  Within Rstudio Terminal add some Example #n files, edit index.qmd, about.qmd

6.  Within Rstudio \> Edit \_quarto.yml to add Example files

7.  Choose a standard HTML theme from list [html-themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html "html-themes") and edit \_quarto.yml appropriately

8.  Check-in files to github

9.  Within Rstudio Terminal run 'quarto publish gh-pages'
